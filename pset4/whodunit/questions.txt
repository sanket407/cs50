1. stdint.h is library which contains new integer types (fixed width, least, fastest etc
2.  they are used in programs where bits represent some entity like pixels. So no. of bits shouldnt change .
3.  BYTE - 1, DWORD - 4 , LONG - 4, WORD - 2 
4.  bfType ie file type
5.  bfSize - Size of bitmap FILE  biSize - Size of bitmap image or structure
6.  if biHeight is negative then bitmap is topdown and its origin is the upper-left corner
7.  biBitCount
8.  File might not exist or if it exists it must be protected and cant be accessed.
9.  That is no. of members we are reading. Here each file will have only one BITMAPFILEHEADER OR BITMAPINFOHEADER. SO 1.
10. 3
11. fseek() skips the padding bits by offsetting them.
12. SEEK_CUR is current position in file where writing / reading is being performed
